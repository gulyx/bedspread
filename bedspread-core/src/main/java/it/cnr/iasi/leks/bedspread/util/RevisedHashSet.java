/**

 * @author gulyx
 *
 * Provided a revised implementation of the HashSet, since the one from Java8 was
 * not behaving in the expected way when dealing with Nodes. Specifically the official implementation
 * consider that 2 objs instances form Node with the referring the same AnyResource
 * are different. Specifically the insertion in the internal table of an HashSet exploits
 * the "hash" method in order to check if the element is present, and which of course my scenario
 * would return different values (independently form any override of "equals").
 * This interpretation should be fine in the general case, but for the moment I 
 * would prefer to consider them "Equals". For further detail consider also the specification
 * of the element "it.cnr.iasi.leks.bedspread.Node".
