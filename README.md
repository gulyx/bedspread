Bedspread - Spreading Activation Algorithm supporting Semantic Similarity
==========================================================================

# Description
This project currently aims to provide a free implementation for 
a spreading activation algorithm supporting Semantic Similarity
among entities/concepts. The design and the development of the
implementation are lead by the [SAKS at CNR-IASI](http://saks.iasi.cnr.it).

The project is using DB-Pedia as reference linked open data cloud.

The project is inspired but independently developed starting from 
the concepts described in the paper:

[Composite interests' exploration thanks to on-the-fly linked data spreading activation](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2481492.2481496)

published in the Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media (part of ECRC)
